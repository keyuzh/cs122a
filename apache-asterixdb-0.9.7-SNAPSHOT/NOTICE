      Creative Commons Legal Code

      CC0 1.0 Universal

          CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
          LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
          ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
          INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
          REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
          PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
          THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
          HEREUNDER.

      Statement of Purpose

      The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
      exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
      and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
      authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

      Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
      the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
      scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
      of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
      works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
      and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
      These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
      culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
      works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
      part through the use and efforts of others.

      For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
      expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
      associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
      is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
      elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
      terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
      Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

      1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
      protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
      Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
      limited to, the following:

        i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
           communicate, and translate a Work;
       ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
           likeness depicted in a Work;
       iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
           subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
           in a Work;
       vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
           European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
           protection of databases, and under any national implementation
           thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
           directive); and
      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
           world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
           implementations thereof.

      2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
      of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
      irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
      Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
      of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
      future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
      worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
      treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
      medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
      including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
      purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
      member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
      successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
      revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
      equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
      as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

      3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
      be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
      Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
      account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
      extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
      person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
      irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
      Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
      maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
      time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
      of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
      limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
      "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
      applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
      reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
      partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
      of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
      will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
      Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
      action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
      express Statement of Purpose.

      4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

       a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
          surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
       b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
          warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
          statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
          title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
          infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
          the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
          the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
       c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
          that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
          limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
          Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
          consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
          Work.
       d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
          party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
          this CC0 or use of the Work.
